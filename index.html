                <p>Sunshine Science School, located in Barzulla Srinagar, Kashmir (190005), was founded in 1992 by the Late Mukhtar Ahmad Dar, who served as its founder and principal. A visionary with a kind heart and deep faith, he was known for his dedication to education and his unwavering support for the underprivileged. He believed in providing quality education to all, regardless of their financial circumstances, and empowered countless students to achieve their dreams.</p>
                <p>Late Mukhtar Ahmad Dar was a deeply religious person who not only focused on academic excellence but also instilled moral and spiritual values in his students. He used to teach the Qur'an and other Islamic teachings to his students, ensuring they grew up with a strong foundation in both worldly knowledge and religious principles.
